# InfluxDB Admin Interface

This is the source for the admin interface that ships with InfluxDB. Feel free to fork this repository,
make changes, and use your own variant of the interface with InfluxDB. It's currenly built using AngularJS.

### Running

The admin interface is built using Middleman, which uses an asset
pipeline for creating static assets.

If you've made changes, and want to test them locally do the following:

```
bundle exec middleman
```

This will run a server on port 4567.


### Building The Assets

If you've made changes, you can rebuild the assets by doing:

```
bundle exec middleman build
```

The resulting files will be in the folder called `build` and will mirror the layout of the files in `source`.


### Contributing

If you add something that you think should be part of the default admin interface, feel free to send us a pull request!
